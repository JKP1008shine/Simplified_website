					<h5><spam class="darkcolour-lg"><b><i>"Excuse me, Tech Ethics! Why?"</i></b></spam> <br><br>Well, recently I was struggling to decide what I should start writing about as my first blog here at Simplified and felt overwhelmed a bit (to be honest). I recently faced a situation where <b>my attention was brought</b> to the fact that in tech we miss <span class="darkcolour-lg"><b> the philosophy behind it, the concept or idea behind it, and what the motive behind introducing them was. And how casually we keep using words interchangeably with the correct one, which misinterprets the concept as a whole</b></span>. <br><br> We are digitising ourselves every day by adding one more application to our devices or learning a new skill. The world is equally misusing these big ideas, but knowing the philosophy behind these creations can educate our ethics, and build a different understanding of technology, preventing any types of misunderstanding.Tech Ethics is a platform where I want to discuss and contribute to these topics so that the real motto of these huge creations can be retained and spread among people over the world who are using it.</h5>

					<h1 class="display-6"><b><span class="darkcolour-lg">Stallmen effect: Freedom of users</b></span></h1>
					<h5 class="caption">Richard Stallman has called the movement with the name <span class="darkcolour-lg"><b>"Free software"</b></span>. Where the word, "free" doesn't mean it is free of cost but the word "free" is used for the user's freedom. <br><br> Now some of you may think, <span class="lightcolor-w"><i>"Why on earth do you sound like a freedom fighter or an activist? This was not your motto! Stop gibberish and talk about real tech!"</i></span> I know, but I will urge you to keep reading as I believe you will soon decide to think about it differently.<br><br>Let me start with quoting Stallman's lines which says ,<span class="darkcolour-lg"><i><b>"Imagine how angry everyone who cooks would be if someday the government says,<span class="lightcolor-w"> from now on, if you share and change your recipe, we are going to call you a Pirate and we are going to put you in prisons.</span> That anger is the basis of free software movement too."</b></i></span><br><br> Here, cooks are we users and the recipes are the codes or scripts or <b>"just in one word"</b> your <span class="darkcolour-lg"><b>ideas</b></span>, which makes the job done, in your <span class="darkcolour-lg"><b> own, unique way.</b></span> Can you sense the freedom here? The freedom to apply changes in your devices which <b>you want</b>, making it work or look like in <b>your own way</b>. This way we provide each of our devices our own identity (<i>our own touch to sound more <span class="lightcolor-w">sophisticated</span>!</i>).<br><br> Everybody will have their own version of the software. How diverse it would have been?! <span class="darkcolour-lg"><span class="big-word-35">Actually</span>,</span> we have examples to show how Free Softwares has brought changes, how people are really making their devices work like <span class="big-word-25"><span class="darkcolour-lg"><b>they</b></span></span> want, look like they want it to look like</h5>
